1. Change it so the dock shows an icon for it. 
2. Add more images. 
3. Make the timer in the desktop show seconds, and make the font thinner. 
4. The dashboard still shows the Pause, end and switch buttons in horrible colours. Correct that. 
5. The hours and minutes textboxes need to be made bigger.
6. The data analytics thingy - one more option in the dashboard to see work done over the week (in tags). Maybe also a calendar thingy.
